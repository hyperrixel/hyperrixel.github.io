As a data scientist at rixel we feel the importance of clear knowledge of a specific dataset. Therefore we decided to make a clean historical overview about covid-19, coronavirus disease. Besides the raw data, we made a simple visualization to help understand how the virus spreads over the globe.

You can find the visualization [here](https://www.hyperrixel.com/covid19map/).

Developers might "play" with the data from our [repository](https://github.com/hyperrixel/covid19map-dataset).
