# Tesseract-OCR in Python, faster!

The repository tessy is the home of the Python module Tessy. This module allows faster access to Tesseract-OCR from Python scripts.

This module is always faster than common Tesseract-OCR wrappers like pytesseract because it uses direct access to Tesseract-OCR's core library instead of calling its executable.

The specification of the connection to the library is based on the [source code](from here: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/blob/master/src/api/capi.cpp).
