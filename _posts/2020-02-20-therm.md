# Therm

Therm is a short python script to show thermal zone temperatures in human readable format on linux. Since almost everything is a file on Unix systems from a certain view it’s just a file reader tool. However it has a very straightforward advantage; you don’t have to read it.

The script itself doesn’t accepts any parameters at the moment but we’ll might change this behavior in the future. Therm uses python 3 but is equipped with shebang to be able to work for you right after you download it.

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/hyperrixel/therm).
