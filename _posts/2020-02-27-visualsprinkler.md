# Find and train the optimum visual classifier

When performance matters artificial intelligence developers should make experiments and even more experiments. *Python*, *PyTorch* and *TorchVision* are ideal frameworks to observe how pretrained models perform on various visual tasks. However those frameworks are very handy to do all of this developers need to code a lot to implement every pretrained model, data loaders, data preprocessing, train loop and evaluation loop. Therefore we made a complex script which put all that together for every developer.
