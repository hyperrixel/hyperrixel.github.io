# Test your PWM from command line

If youâ€™re interested in any level of robotics as a software developer or you just want to jump in topic for a while getting to know how PWM works is essential. Therefore we built a small script that makes testing the behavior of a PWM controller very easy and straightforward because you can give commands to the controller runtime.

The repository is available [here](https://github.com/hyperrixel/pwm_test).
